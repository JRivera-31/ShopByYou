## Project Description

ShopByYou is a simple, hassle free way for users to shop and sell online. While shopping, a user can flip through the categories to find the products they are seeking with ease, and sellers can post listings based on criteria that will put their products on the shelves of our virtual storefront.

The application is deployed on Heroku for the server to run and function properly.
